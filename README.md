This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Overview
This project was created under the cooperation of Gokul Srinivasan, Brian Wang, and Dev Kapadia. Our project, 
DartPoll, was designed to be used by Dartmouth students as a polling service where students could post and respond to polls. Our project focuses around the administration of polls, and the vizualization of the subsequent poll results. 

## Project Responsibilities

The primary components of the project and their delegations will be listed below

Gokul Srinvasan: 

* Creation and integration of backend with polling app
* Development and implementation of routing system 
* Primary project scaffolding 
* Poll creation and integration with backend
* Voting feature and integration with backend
* Integration of data visualization with backend
* Creation and implementation of authentication
* Interation of timing feature with backend

Brian Wang: 

* Development of basic scaffolding of posting and deleting polls 
* Creation and implementation of time limit feature and visiualization of time limits
* Creation and implementation of voting visualization 
 * Assistance in implementing voting visualizations with backend

Dev Kapadia:

* Implementation of all styling





## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
